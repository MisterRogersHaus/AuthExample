This simple app is build demonstrating some simple auth functions (signin, signout, signup). It's fairly straighfoward, but was built with the following in mind:
* Leverage swift UI, macOS 15.x, xCode beta5, Swift 5
* Leverage Firebase web / json authentication
* Leverage Alamofire
* Follow SwiftUI patterns for describing a crossplatform UI, observing objects, environment objects, etc.
